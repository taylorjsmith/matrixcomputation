# MatrixComputation
## Summary

This repository contains a selection of small programs that implement algorithms taught in my graduate-level course on matrix computation.

The goal of each program is to see how to translate an algorithm from pseudocode to actual code. Therefore, efficiency is not a primary consideration. A more efficient (built-in) implementation is run alongside my implementation as a comparison/benchmark.

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you will need to install the current version of [Python](https://www.python.org) as well as the [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org) packages.
